* Do not delete this directory!
* It is used by the test server to run tests.
* It is included in Git on purpose.
* From what I know, it doesn't violate any licenses and downloads all dependencies on runtime.
* All dependencies are downloaded from official sources, however, they are not verified. 
* Do not use start.sh to run the server, it is only for testing purposes. You'd have to download Purpur's server.jar first.
